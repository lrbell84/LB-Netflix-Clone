## Welcome to my Netflix clone project with firebase database!

This project is a clone of the popular streaming service, Netflix. It is built with ReactJS and uses a firebase database for storing data. It is written in with the create-react-app boilerplate. The project includes a React Router, which allows for routing to different pages within the app. The app also uses the Reach Router, which allows for routing to different pages within the app without having to refresh the page. The project includes a React Context, which allows for managing state throughout the app. The project also includes a React Hook, which allows for using state and lifecycle methods in functional components. The project includes a React Component, which allows for modularizing the code and making the code more reusable.

To get started, simply fork this repository and clone it to your local machine. Then, install all dependencies by running `npm install` in your terminal. Once all dependencies are installed, you can start the project by running `npm start`.

Thank you for checking out my project!
